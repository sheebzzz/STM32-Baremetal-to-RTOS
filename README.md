# STM32-Baremetal-to-RTOS

This repository documents my learning path from **bare-metal driver development on STM32** to **real-time applications using FreeRTOS**.  
It demonstrates how to move from direct register programming to building structured, multitasking embedded systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Phases

### **Phase 1 ‚Äì Bare-Metal Foundations**
- Blink LED using registers only (no HAL/LL).
- GPIO driver (button + LED).
- UART driver (TX/RX characters).
- Timer driver (delay, PWM).
- I2C/SPI drivers (communicate with a sensor).

### **Phase 2 ‚Äì Intro to FreeRTOS**
- Set up FreeRTOS on STM32 (SysTick scheduler).
- Create tasks for LED blink, UART communication, sensor polling.
- Use semaphores, queues, and mutexes for synchronization.
- Interrupt-driven task notifications (UART RX).

### **Phase 3 ‚Äì Advanced FreeRTOS**
- Periodic tasks with software timers.
- Event groups for coordination.
- Middleware integration (FATFS on SD card, LWIP networking).
- Performance measurement (latency, context switch).
